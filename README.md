## Contributing
You can contribute by submitting an issue, or by picking an existing one from the list and sending a PR. Ensure that the branch underlying the PR is up-to-date with latest changes. Contributors must ensure they add any significant changes to the [changelog](CHANGELOG.md) in the same PR itself.

All changes must be made on top of a new branch forked off the `development` branch. The `master` branch is only updated when a new release is made.

Commit messages should follow common guidelines, such as the ones mentioned [here](https://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/), whenever possible.

Mention keywords such as "Fixes" or "Closes" in commit messages, followed by the issue number, to automatically close corresponding issues. [(List of keywords)](https://help.github.com/articles/closing-issues-using-keywords/)
